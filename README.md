# Task Manager

## Project Description
This project is a task manager webapp that allows user to add, complete, and delete new tasks, assign tasks with levels of importance, deadlines, and descriptions, and will have a visual to indicate
their progress on their ongoing tasks in order to motivate them to continue adding and completing tasks.

## Technologies
For the frontend, I use React, HTML, CSS, and JS. I have imported a template React project, which is why the frontend folder is currently a submodule. I am working to migrate it to a fresh folder that
will properly display my files on GitHub. 

For the backend, I use Python through the Django REST framework. 

## Current Progress
This is an ongoing project, and I am still working to develop the visual that was mentioned in the project description. However, here is the link to the video of my progress so far:
